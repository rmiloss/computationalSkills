# Pre-Programming 2: Documentation and Error Messages
(with some review of regular expressions)

###Close reading of error messages

   * [ls -z]
   * [filename as command]
   * [cp file file file]
   * [ejecting a disk in use]
   * [Python with a curly quote]
   * other error messages we've seen?
   * The power of Google
###Documentation and man pages

   * grep / regular expression docs
   * mark up printout of ls, where do you get stuck?
   * [read the man page to find how to print files in reverse order]
   * [how to use cat to print line numbers?]
   * Searching for help: 
   * knowledge transfer: regular expressions in word processors!
###Review

   * Things we've covered: the command line, file paths, an assortment of useful commands
   * More things we've covered: regular expressions, basically very complex search and pattern matching
   * Things you now understand: if a geek says *, it means "everything"; if a geek says $job, it means "whatever job makes sense in context here"
   * What was going on with that [[:digit:]] backreference
   * How to grep for single quotes, dollar signs, etc.
###Project 

   * install Mallet (\url{http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/index.php} )!
   * Get stuck, get a chocolate
   * This is an exercise in running into problems and resolving them, not an exercise in showing how skilled you are!
