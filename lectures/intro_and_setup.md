## Aims and contents of the course
This course is intended to provide basic training and support for further skills courses in the Digital Humanities. It is strongly recommended as a prerequisite to the other DH practical courses.
As such, students will be required to bring a laptop computer (no tablets!) If this presents a problem, please contact one of the course instructors in advance.
- Introduction to the command line
- Introduction to file formats and filesystems
- Solving the mystery of special characters
- Understanding how the Internet works behind the browser
- Things you ought to know about your (Mac / Windows / Linux) operating system
- Where to go for help and how to understand the answers

We will also try to accompany the contents of each course with some practical steps of the exercise, which will lead to a final project in the end.

### Grading & Attendance
Attendance in every lecture is required due to the PI type of block-course.

Regular attendance, following the practical exercise tasks during the lecture and active participation will lead to a final grade.

## Required Setup and Tools
- Create a personal GitHub account: https://github.com/join
- Download and install Atom code editor: https://atom.io/
- (Only Windows users) Download and install Gitbash: https://gitforwindows.org/

## Getting to know your OS
* [macOS](#mac)
* [Windows](#windows)

Operating systems are system software which manage computer hardware and software resources. They provide common services for computer programs and interfaces for humans to interact with.

![Operating System](images/operating_system.png)

Most common current OS are:  
Windows (Microsoft)  
macOS (Apple)  
Linux (Linux community, open-source)  
Mobile: Android (Google, based on Linux kernel)  
Mobile: iOS (Apple)  

# Mac

## File system hierarchy 

* What are files?
* What are directories/folders? <!--Thinking about why we call them folders: a folder and a piece of paper are the same, and can do some of the same things. A folder can also hold pieces of paper.-->
* What are programs? <!--Programs are files that can do something, but are still files nonetheless. Take a piece of paper out of your folder, fold it into an airplane, and throw it. It's still a piece of paper you can read from and write on, but it can fly.-->
* GUI file explorers and file hierarchy
* `/` as the center of the filesystem universe (exception: Windows)
* Directories are a special kind of file
* `/dev/null`: the black hole of the file system
* Finding the filesystem location of a file from the MacOS Finder or Windows Explorer: Drag the filename from a Finder windows and drop it in a terminal window to paste the path to the file. Or just view the filename by selecting the file and `Cmd+i` (get info).


## Configuring your machine to show hidden files

* Mac OS Sierra: Open Finder and hit `Cmd+Shift+.` Do the same thing to turn off hidden files.
* Mac OS El Capitan: Open the command line and execute `defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES` (or `NO`); restart Finder whenever you change this


## Configuring your machine to show filename extensions

* Open Finder and select Preferences, click “Advanced”, and check the box next to “Show all filename extensions”.

## About files

* Why are some files hidden? <!--If you change something, however small, in some of these files, you can break your computer. Be careful!-->
* **Case sensitive** vs **case preserving**: Linux is **case sensitive**, meaning files with the same name but different capitalization are different files (e.g., `finalpaper.txt` is different than `FinalPaper.txt`). Mac OS and Windows are **case preserving**, but not case sensitive. <!-- (This preference can be changed when configuring the filesystem, but certain programs will not run in a case sensitive environment, so it’s best to leave it alone). A case preserving file system will spell the filename as you type it, but if you create a different file with a name that differs only in capitalization, it will overwrite the first one. We recommend not creating filenames that differ only in capitalization even on Linux; not only is it potentially confusing, but you may be collaborating on a project with someone not on Linux. -->
* **Spaces** in a file and directory names. Why could these be problematic? 


## File ownership and permissions

* `ls -l`
* user, group, other
* `chown` (You probably can’t change ownership on shared systems and don’t need to do it on your own machine. This command is useful if you install something incorrectly.)
* `chmod` (“644”, “664” for files; “755”, “775” for directories)


## Launching a terminal

* The **Terminal.app** that you will find in the Applications → Utilities folder. (Many Mac users prefer the free third-party <https://www.iterm2.com/>.)
* For Ubuntu Desktop (Unity): you can hit Ctrl-Alt-T or you can type `Terminal` into the Search box.

## Moving through a filesystem
<!-- Move the programs and files stuff in here, use cmd.exe -->
<!-- where is home?  both in cmd and in gui-->
<!-- language differences for gui and command line-->

* Navigate up and down, with emphasis on the paths in the title bar 
* `cd`: change directory <!--Open a command line and begin using `cd`. Explain that `cd` is essentially the same as selecting or clicking a folder. `cd` into your home directory.-->
* `ls`: list all files  <!--Use `ls` to show all the files in your current (when you first open the terminal, home) directory. Compare that to what you now see in your home directory (or C drive “folder”). Then use `cd Documents` to move into your documents folder. This is a relative path, as you’ve navigated relative to where you’ve started. Explain what an absolute path looks like, and try running one. Then run a few relative paths.-->

## File/directory path in file explorer GUI vs. shell 

* Matching the GUI file path with the file/directory path in the terminal
* User-specific directories: where are your home directory, document folder, and desktop? What are their full file/directory paths? 
* Non-English OS’s may have translation/localization applied, but only on the GUI side! Why is this?

## External drives and mounting
How removable and external drives (such as a USB thumbdrive) are treated in GUI vs. terminal environment

* In Mac OS, they are mounted underneath `/Volumes` when you plug them in. Unmount them by following the instructions at [Mount and unmount drives from the command line in Mac OS X](http://osxdaily.com/2013/05/13/mount-unmount-drives-from-the-command-line-in-mac-os-x/). 
 	
## How to run a program as an administrator

* The GUI will generally ask you if you need to do this
* On the command line, precede the command with `sudo`.

* GUI file explorers and file hierarchy

## Configuring your machine to show filename extensions

* <[screenshot](images/getting_to_know_winconfig.png)> In any File Explorer window, click on “View” tab, and then “Options” on the right to open the “Folder Options” window. 
	* In the “View” tab, uncheck “Hide extensions for known file types” box.

## Configuring your machine to show hidden files, and more

* <[screenshot](images/getting_to_know_winconfig.png)> In the same “Folder Options” window as before, 
	* Check “Show hidden files, folders, and drives”. 
		* NOTE: Protected operating system files will still stay hidden.  
	* Also check “Display the full path in the title bar” (not essential, but recommended).

## About files

* Why are some files hidden? <!--If you change something, however small, in some of these files, you can break your computer. Be careful!-->
* **Case sensitive** vs **case preserving**
	* Linux is **case sensitive**, meaning files with the same name but different capitalization are different files (e.g., `finalpaper.txt` is different than `FinalPaper.txt`).

## Launching a terminal

* The Command Prompt **cmd.exe** <[screenshot](images/getting_to_know_cmd.png)> is the native Windows console, which grew out of DOS.  We will be using it in this session. 
	* How to launch: from the Start menu type in “cmd”. 
	* NOTE: For later sessions and the remainder of this institute we will be using the **bash shell** instead, which you downloaded and installed as part of Git. This is the command line interface we use and recommend.

## Moving through a filesystem
<!-- Move the programs and files stuff in here, use cmd.exe -->
<!-- where is home?  both in cmd and in gui-->
<!-- language differences for gui and command line-->

* Navigate up and down, with emphasis on the paths in the title bar <!-- We should clarify that Git Bash will use forward slashes rather than backslashes, and explain later when we introduce cmd why that's the case.-->
* Drive letter in Windows: `C:\Users` (Windows `cmd`)
	* Drive letter elsewhere: `/c/Users` (Windows Git `bash`), `/Users` (no drive letter in Mac OS and Linux)
* `cd`: change directory <!--Open a command line and begin using `cd`. Explain that `cd` is essentially the same as selecting or clicking a folder. `cd` into your home directory.-->
* `dir`: list all files

## File/directory path in File Explorer GUI vs. cmd 

* Matching the GUI file path with the file/directory path in the terminal
* User-specific directories: where are your home directory, document folder, and desktop? What are their full file/directory paths? 
* Non-English OS’s may have translation/localization applied, but only on the GUI side! 
	* In Spanish Windows, a user’s Documents folder would appear in File Explorer as “Usarios > jeremy > Documentos”
	* The same folder will appear on the command line as `C:\Users\jeremy\Documents`

## External drives and mounting
How removable and external drives (such as a USB thumbdrive) are treated in GUI vs. terminal environment

* In Windows, they are assigned a new drive letter: `d:\` `e:\` (cmd)
* In Git bash environment (will learn this later), they look like: `/d/` `/e/` 

## How to run a program as an administrator

* Right click on a program icon (say, Command Prompt) and select “Run as administrator”. 
	* **CAUTION!** You may accidentally break your system by removing essential files or directories.
	* Use only when you have a good reason to; close program when done. 

## Environment variables (aka system variables)

* How to view environment variables through a GUI
	* File Explorer -> Right click on 'This PC', select 'Properties' -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables 
* How to view environment variables in a terminal
	* In `cmd`, type in: `set`
